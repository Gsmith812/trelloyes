# Trelloyes
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is meant to resemble the layout of the popular trello application and was the first application, I used to begin learning React.js. I learned how to leverage the library to break down an application into separate component structures, creating a more manageable and scaleable application.
